YAMLKit
=======

YAMLKit is an Objective-C library wrapping the [LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) library.

It is written by Patrick Thomson and licensed under the MIT License.

It is still very preliminary, but can parse YAML and emit some Cocoa data structures.

Thanks to:
* Laurent Sansonetti for the idea and encouragement
* The LibYAML team
